-> Basic monitoring data about every 5min
-> Detail Monitoring works with every 1min apart form every thing same.
-> cloudwatch provide the various metrics and key aspects.
-> Key aspects provides Alarms
-> CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define.

Metrics :
 . Metrics are data about the performance of your systems.
 . Metric data is kept for a period of 15 months, enabling you to view both up-to-the-minute data and historical data.
 
CloudWatch Alarms:
 . You can create a CloudWatch alarm that watches a single metric. 
 . The alarm performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold over a number of time periods.
 
Alarm States:
 . OK—The metric is within the defined threshold
 . ALARM—The metric is outside of the defined threshold
 . INSUFFICIENT_DATA—The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state
 
CloudWatch Alarms Treats Missing Data:
 . missing (The alarm looks back farther in time to find additional data points)
 . notBreaching (Treated as a data point that is within the threshold)
 . breaching (Treated as a data point that is breaching the threshold)
 . ignore (The current alarm state is maintained) 
 
-> You can create up to 5000 alarms per region per AWS account.

# apt-get install stress
# stress --cpu  8 --timeout 200s


-> <=2

-> Alarms : whenever cloudwatch going to cross certain threshold you can setup Alarms for that.

To extend root volume filesystem:

# install "cloud-guest-utils" if it is not installed already
apt install cloud-guest-utils
# resize partition
